Doesn't do much anymore. I didn't like the previous design (or lack of), so I'm 
rewriting alot of the code. Also started using googletest to write unit tests. 
All tests are in the tests directory, and can be built from the Makefile in the 
make directory.

Added a lot of documentation. Using the Doxyfile, the doxygen tool can generate 
html and latex documentation for easier viewing.
