There are 3 important classes that work together to provide a very simple, but
powerful and extensible memory system.

MemoryInterface - Defines an interface through which anything representing 
    some subset of the address space interacts with other components.
    The other two classes both implement this interface.

Memory - The top layer; this class represents a fully implemented address
    space without making any decisions as to what certain parts of memory 
    should do. However it does rely on two ideas:
        1) An instance of Memory for the gameboy (and this class) is tied
           to a particular cartridge.
        2) The functions of memory are defined for certain ranges of addresses.
    Only a single instance of this class should be used.

MemoryCustomizer - To implement functionality, extend this class and register
    an instance of the subclass with the Memory object. One instance of 
    such a subclass may implement all the functions for a certain address range
    or multiple address ranges.
